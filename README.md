## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced deep learning-based image colorization system that converts black and white images to color images using state-of-the-art neural network techniques. The system leverages the Lab color space and a pre-trained Caffe model to achieve high-quality colorization results.

### Key Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Colorization**: Uses a pre-trained Caffe neural network model
- **Lab Color Space Processing**: Optimized for grayscale to color conversion
- **Modern GUI Interface**: Professional graphical user interface with real-time feedback
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images simultaneously
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation of colorization quality
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging system
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient image processing pipeline

## Technical Architecture

### Color Space Theory

The system operates in the Lab color space, which consists of three channels:
- **L channel**: Represents lightness (grayscale information)
- **a channel**: Represents green-red color information
- **b channel**: Represents blue-yellow color information

This color space is particularly suitable for colorization because the grayscale information is encoded only in the L channel, while color information is contained in the a and b channels.

### Neural Network Architecture

The system uses a pre-trained Caffe model with the following characteristics:
- **Input**: L channel (lightness) of the image
- **Output**: a and b channels (color information)
- **Training Data**: ImageNet dataset
- **Model Type**: Deep Convolutional Neural Network

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Image Loading**: Load input grayscale image
2. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert to Lab color space
3. **L Channel Extraction**: Extract lightness channel
4. **Neural Network Processing**: Predict a and b channels
5. **Channel Combination**: Combine L, a, and b channels
6. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert back to RGB/BGR
7. **Output Generation**: Save colorized image

#### Batch Processing
```python
from src.colorizer import ImageColorizer

# Initialize colorizer
colorizer = ImageColorizer()

# Process single image
image = cv.imread("input.jpg")
colorized = colorizer.colorize_image(image)
cv.imwrite("output.png", colorized)

# Batch processing
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
results = colorizer.batch_colorize(image_paths, "./output")
```

### Graphical User Interface

Launch the modern GUI:
```bash
python src/gui.py
```

**GUI Features**:

- Real-time processing feedback
- Before/after image comparison
- Quality metrics display
- Batch processing capabilities
- Professional styling

### API Usage

```python
from src.colorizer import ImageColorizer
import cv2 as cv

# Initialize the colorizer
colorizer = ImageColorizer()

# Load and process an image
image = cv.imread("black_white_image.jpg")
colorized_image = colorizer.colorize_image(image)

# Save the result
cv.imwrite("colorized_image.png", colorized_image)

# Evaluate quality
metrics = colorizer.evaluate_colorization(image, colorized_image)
print(f"SSIM: {metrics['ssim']:.4f}")
print(f"PSNR: {metrics['psnr']:.2f} dB")
print(f"Colorfulness: {metrics['colorfulness']:.2f}")

# Create comparison plot

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates colorization quality using multiple metrics:

### Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Purpose**: Measures structural similarity between original and colorized images
- **Interpretation**: Values above 0.9 indicate excellent quality

### Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- **Range**: Typically 20-40 dB (higher is better)
- **Purpose**: Measures image quality and noise levels
- **Interpretation**: Values above 30 dB indicate good quality

### Colorfulness Score
- **Range**: Varies based on image content
- **Purpose**: Measures the vibrancy and color richness
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more vibrant colors
